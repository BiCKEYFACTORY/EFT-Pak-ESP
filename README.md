# EFT Pak ESP
 Modded Escape From Tarkov Unity Files. The textures from the .manifest and .bundle files were edited. There are some methods that allow the user to bypass the consistency check.
 Bypass used: Files must have the right file size as the original ones.

 These files were 'cracked' from p2c scammers who just build a license wall around some files :clown:
 Item ESP is from the thread linked down below.
